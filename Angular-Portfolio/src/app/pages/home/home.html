                                <p>Hello everyone!!! My name is <strong>Muhammad Idzhans Khairi</strong>, but you can call me <strong>Idzhans</strong>. If it is hard for you, then you can call me <strong>Hans</strong> instead. It will be much easier for sure. This website is not just a portfolio for a tech company, but also a portfolio of whatever I love to do. It‚Äôs a great way to introduce myself!</p>

                                <p>I was born on <strong>1st of July 2001</strong>, and my coding journey actually started during my <strong>Pusat Asasi Sains Universiti Malaya (PASUM)</strong> years. I have loved building things such as <em>legos, puzzles</em>, and more since I was a kid. During PASUM, I discovered programming and fell in love with it. My Angular and web development skills improved significantly during my internship at <strong>FusionEx</strong>. Since then, I started building websites and experimenting with new projects during my free time.</p>

                                <p>Do I just do coding? <strong>Obviously not!</strong> I love music üéµ, playing musical instruments, singing, and even making music. I‚Äôve self-learned piano, guitar, electric guitar, gamelan, and basic music production using <em>BandLab</em>. I hope to further expand my music-making skills to create high-quality original songs. One of my favorite spots is <strong>Swee Lee, Lot 10</strong>, a musical instrument store with a cafe. My favorite band? So far, it‚Äôs <strong>FUGO!</strong> You can check them out <a href="https://youtu.be/gpWVeIRz8Fc?si=xQWgv3mcVZg_qyWZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

                                <p>Sports? <strong>Yes, I have interests!</strong> I started rock climbing üßó‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è around April 2023. Initially, I was looking for a part-time job at Uniqlo or H&M, but I ended up at <strong>Camp 5</strong> instead. I worked there for almost 2.5 years and gained experience in <em>bouldering, top-rope, and lead climbing</em>. I‚Äôve also become a guide at Camp 5 and am currently pursuing certification as a <strong>Basic Bouldering Instructor</strong>. I aim to become a <strong>Basic Wall Course Instructor</strong> in the future to share my passion for climbing. Maybe later, I‚Äôll also teach private climbing lessons once I improve further!</p>

                                <p>So yes, interesting things about me: I‚Äôm extroverted (sometimes introverted too), and I have many hobbies and interests. Want to chat about web projects or climbing? Feel free to contact me! Maybe we can have some <em>Teh Tarik</em> at a mamak ‚òï or coffee at Swee Lee.</p>

                                        <p>Starting my degree at <strong>Universiti Malaya</strong>, I faced the decision of whether to pursue <strong>Software Engineering</strong> or <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>. In the end, I chose Artificial Intelligence‚Äîa path that not only broadened my technical knowledge but also gave me countless valuable experiences beyond the lecture halls, especially through assignments and group projects.</p>

                                        <p>During my studies, I often took on the role of <strong>group leader</strong>. This taught me how to manage projects effectively, plan tasks, and guide my teammates toward a common goal. There was even a semester where I had to lead five group projects at once‚Äîa challenging and stressful responsibility, but one that sharpened my skills in organization, prioritization, and teamwork. These experiences helped me grow into a more resilient and adaptive leader.</p>

                                        <p>I also developed strong communication skills, not just in presenting projects to lecturers and peers, but also in collaborating with teammates‚Äîdiscussing concerns, resolving conflicts, and ensuring smooth execution of our work. This ability to communicate clearly and effectively became one of my strongest assets throughout my academic journey.</p>

                                        <p>During my studies, I completed an <strong>internship at FusionEx</strong>, which enhanced my <strong>Angular</strong> and web development skills. This experience proved invaluable when I later developed my Final Year Project (FYP), <strong>Tatabahasa</strong>, a web application for Malay text normalization that leverages <strong>JamAI Base</strong> as the underlying Large Language Model (LLM) technology.</p>

                                        <p>Across seven semesters, I worked on many projects, including:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>A Cinema Ticketing Ordering System using Java</li>
                                            <li>An Emotion-Detecting Diary using Python</li>
                                            <li>A Fitness App developed with R</li>
                                            <li>My Final Year Project: <strong>Tatabahasa</strong> for Malay text normalization</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        

                                        <p>Beyond academics, I kept a balance by actively joining activities outside my faculty. I participated in college and university events and became a member of <strong>University Malaya Global Buddies (UMGB)</strong>, where I helped take care of international mobility students. These activities exposed me to a diverse range of people with different mindsets, personalities, and cultures. Through this, I learned not only new perspectives and ideas but also simple things like fashion and self-expression‚Äîwhich I personally value.</p>

                                                    After completing my <strong>SPM</strong> at 
                                                    <strong>Sekolah Menengah Sains Tengku Abdullah (SEMESTA)</strong>, 
                                                    I continued my pre-university studies at 
                                                    <strong>Pusat Asasi Sains Universiti Malaya (PASUM)</strong>. 
                                                    This was also the year when the <strong>COVID-19 outbreak</strong> began, 
                                                    which meant that most of my classes‚Äîincluding lab experiments‚Äîwere conducted 
                                                    <em>online and virtually</em>.
                                                </p>

                                                <p>
                                                    Despite these challenges, my one year at PASUM was deeply meaningful. 
                                                    It was during this time that I was first introduced to <strong>programming</strong>. 
                                                    Before PASUM, I had never touched or explored anything related to coding, 
                                                    but the programming subject sparked my interest and quickly grew into a passion. 
                                                    This newfound love for programming became the main reason why I decided to 
                                                    pursue a degree in <strong>Computer Science</strong>.
                                                </p>

                                                <p>
                                                    Along the way, I also met many <strong>new friends</strong>‚Äîwho remain close to me to this day‚Äî 
                                                    and was guided by <strong>supportive lecturers</strong> who helped me throughout 
                                                    the two semesters of my foundation studies.

                                                    In <strong>Form 5</strong>, I was honored to serve as a <strong>Prefect</strong>, 
                                                    holding the role of <strong>Head of Protocol Bureau</strong>. 
                                                    This position taught me valuable lessons in <strong>leadership, organization, and planning</strong>, 
                                                    ensuring weekly assemblies and official ceremonies ran smoothly.

                                                <p>
                                                    Most importantly, SEMESTA provided me with <strong>supportive teachers</strong> and a 
                                                    <strong>nurturing environment</strong> that shaped both my academic journey and personal growth ‚Äî 
                                                    laying the foundation for who I am today.
